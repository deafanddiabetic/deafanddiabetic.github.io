        <h1>Red</h1>
        <center><img src="Red Wheel.png" alt="Red shades"></center>
		<p>Red is a passionate color that may evoke feelings of anger or aggression in certain context but is classically a color that raises blood pressure and metabolic rate that is also associated with feelings of love and strength.</p>
		<h1>Orange</h1>
        <center><img src="Orange Wheel.png" alt="Orange Shades"></center>
		<p>Orange is an excellent accent color that adds a lighter or more peaceful tone to a color scheme. As a main color will give a childlike appearance or cause a subject to be taken in a lighter context than a neutral or bold cool color will. </p>
        <h1>Yellow</h1>
        <center><img src="Yellow Wheel.png" alt="Yellow Shades"></center>
        <p>Yellow is a calming color that works well as an accent to neutrals and adds a vibrant tone to color scheme. Pastel yellow can be a subtle dynamic change while a bright canary yellow will add a youthful and relaxing vibe.</p>
        <h1>Green</h1>
        <center><img src="Green Wheel.png" alt="Green Shades"></center>
        <p>Green is tradtionally a calming color, running the spectrum from a more neutral based olive color to a pastel or bright green as an accent. Also associated with earth tones, green in conjunction with other neutral colors can be a professional, simple accent color.</p>
        <h1>Blue</h1>
        <center><img src="Blue Wheel.png" alt="Blue Shades"></center>
        <p>Blue is a classic calming and relaxing color. It can be bright, bold and vibrant or muted pastel as an accent. It can be a powerful color associated with water and earth tones. Blue is a primary color and universally useable in many design aspects.</p>
        <h1>Purple</h1>
        <center><img src="Purple Wheel.png" alt="Purple Shades"></center>
        <p>Purple would strike me as a bold color choice for a main pallette. A restaurant, an artistic exhibition website possibly. I would not imagine a law office or industrial fastener business using purple for a main theme but it is also a cooler color and calming to the eye.</p>
        <h1>White</h1>
        <center><img src="White Wheel.png" alt="White Shades"></center>
        <p>White is a classic, clean, simple color that provides a great base for a website to build a pallete from. Since every other color could potentionally work as an accent color, I see white as the foundation of every webpage and it immediately catches my eye when used as the main background color. </p>
        <h1>Gray</h1>
        <center><img src="Grey Wheel.png" alt="Grey"></center>
        <p>I associate grey as an industrial color with a clean and professional tone. Also works well as an accent but for grey as the main scheme would be soothing to look at and a nice clean palette to build from. </p>
        <h1>Black</h1>
        <center><img src="Black Wheel.png" alt="Black"></center>
        <p>Black as a main color also provides the same style of clean slate that white may, but much more bold. Accent neutral colors with spots of brighter colors work well with black. When I see a website with black as its main focus it draws my eyes to the accents more keenly.</p>
        <h1>Brown</h1>
        <center><img src="Brown Wheel.png" alt="Brown Shades"></center>
		<p>Brown as a main theme is also closely tied to earth tones and works well with lighter accents. Brown would be a strange choice for a main color and I wouldn't find it very pleasing. Tan or a lighter hue could work well, but I would think you'd want your business represented by a better color palette.</p>
    <h1>Pink</h1>
        <center><img src="Pink Wheel.png" alt="Pink Shades"></center>
        <p>Pink as main site color would be a very strong choice. I've seen it work well for bakeries and cupckae companies, with darker accent colors. I would stay away from neon or vibrant pinks as it would distract me and not be a comforting color. A pastel pink could be a more relaxing base to choose.</p>
