        <h1>Silo Skateboard Shop</h1>
        <a href="www.silostore.com">www.silostore.com</a>
        <p>The Silo store website has been the most influential website in my personal life.</p>
        <p>The site has remained the same for most of its ten year existence and the style and user experience of it is ideal for me.</p>
        <p>Silo is a skateboard and apparel shop that is run by good friends of mine, one of whom is a graphic designer and he built this website. I've always respected and appreciated the simplicity and grace of this website. The navigation is very readable and attractive, it does exactly what it needs to do in terms of leading customers to the actual marketplace but shows off the cultural influence and style that Silo as a brand is known for.</p>
        <p>Their use of colors palletes consisting of the mint green, black, white and grey tones are their signature colors and play well against the stylistic forward thinking products they carry.</p>
        <p>I've always admired how the marketplace has javascript scroll over information if you move your cursor over the image of the product, it will display it's price, quantity, etc. Very effective and attractive. The footer is also a strong suit for me, it has the location and hours of the shop, simple undefined links to other webpages and friends of whom the shop is in relation with. </p>
        <p>My personal websites I've built over the years have always followed this general formula and will continue to influence it for years to come.</p>
        <h1>Adventure Motorcycle Rider Forums</h1>
        <a href="www.advrider.com">www.advrider.com</a>
        <p>The Adventure Motorcycle Forums are a specific group of enthusiasts who buy/sell/trade motorcycle parts and contribute technical articles and adventure stories of their motorcycle riding experiences.</p>
        <p>This website is much more utilitarian but is easily the cleanest forum I've ever been active on. There are very few ads and they are not distracting to the user experience by popping up, sliding over clickable links or interfering with the navigation and useage of the pages at all.</p>
        <p>There isn't much to look at besides database style lists for the various forums, simple avatars and boxed in bordered comment sections. Visually it may not be very appealing, but for the little it has in graphic detail it does use an interesting color scheme of dark greys, black primarly and accents of a muted orange.</p>
        <p>The only unfortunate user experience to mention is the image uploading platform is less than satisfactory. It took a few tries to understand what they needed you to click, the buttons and format are not user friendly. The image uploads from your computer and goes into a "queue" then you submit the request, then make your edits and add caption, then submit for approval, then finally it sends you to a confirmation screen. I feel like 3 or 4 of these steps could've been streamlined into a single page or user input pop-up or form.</p>
        
        <h1>Aaron Joseph Photography</h1>
        <a href="www.aaron-joseph.com">www.aaron-joseph.com</a>
        <p>My friend Aaron Joseph is a professional photographer based out of Brooklyn, NY. His website has also been a personal favorite for many years.</p>
        <p>With an eye for strong images, he uses the functionality of his site to make the pictures talk instead of loading the user down with links, navigation, or other extras that distract from his art and professional site/resume.</p>
        <p>The simple navigation links in an attractive font against a slightly off white eggshell background are effective and simulate the backgrounds used in art galleries where his prints and photos are typically displayed.</p>
        <p>The left swiping of the trackpad or phone screen elegantly move the parade of images across the screen and the offset placement of the images along that path make the site more interesting visually than a simple scroll of equal sized rectangular images.</p>
        <p>If I were to make a similar site, I would personally put a footer with contact information and a link to my resume but I understand his goal with this type of display to focus more on the art than the artist directly.</p><!--
